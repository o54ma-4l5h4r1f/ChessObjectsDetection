# ChessObjectsDetection
There is a lot of objects detection methods, But Most of the recent successful methods are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), <br>
One of the Neural network approaches is You Only Look Once (YOLO), which we going to deal with in this project.
<br> <br>

for more illustration on the project, please check out the [Readme.pdf]()
